Usage of {safeTransferFrom} prevents loss, though the caller must understand this adds an external call which potentially creates a reentrancy vulnerability. Requirements: - `from` cannot be the zero address. - `to` cannot be the zero address. - `tokenId` token must be owned by `from`. - If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}. Emits a {Transfer} event.\"}},\"title\":\"ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard, optional metadata extension\",\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/IERC721Metadata.sol\":\"IERC721Metadata\"},\"evmVersion\":\"london\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[],\"viaIR\":true},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x5bce51e11f7d194b79ea59fe00c9e8de9fa2c5530124960f29a24d4c740a3266\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://7e66dfde185df46104c11bc89d08fa0760737aa59a2b8546a656473d810a8ea4\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmXvyqtXPaPss2PD7eqPoSao5Szm2n6UMoiG8TZZDjmChR\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/IERC721Metadata.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x75b829ff2f26c14355d1cba20e16fe7b29ca58eb5fef665ede48bc0f9c6c74b9\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://a0a107160525724f9e1bbbab031defc2f298296dd9e331f16a6f7130cec32146\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmemujxSd7gX8A9M8UwmNbz4Ms3U9FG9QfudUgxwvTmPWf\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x447a5f3ddc18419d41ff92b3773fb86471b1db25773e07f877f548918a185bf1\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://be161e54f24e5c6fae81a12db1a8ae87bc5ae1b0ddc805d82a1440a68455088f\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmP7C3CHdY9urF4dEMb9wmsp1wMxHF6nhA2yQE5SKiPAdy\"]}},\"version\":1}","evm":{"legacyAssembly":null,"assembly":null,"bytecode":null,"methodIdentifiers":{"approve(address,uint256)":"095ea7b3","balanceOf(address)":"70a08231","getApproved(uint256)":"081812fc","isApprovedForAll(address,address)":"e985e9c5","name()":"06fdde03","ownerOf(uint256)":"6352211e","safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)":"42842e0e","safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256,bytes)":"b88d4fde","setApprovalForAll(address,bool)":"a22cb465","supportsInterface(bytes4)":"01ffc9a7","symbol()":"95d89b41","tokenURI(uint256)":"c87b56dd","transferFrom(address,address,uint256)":"23b872dd"}},"irOptimized":""}},"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol":{"Address":{"abi":[],"metadata":{"optimizer_settings":"M3B3","solc_metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.8+commit.dddeac2f\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Collection of functions related to the address type\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol\":\"Address\"},\"evmVersion\":\"london\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[],\"viaIR\":true},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x006dd67219697fe68d7fbfdea512e7c4cb64a43565ed86171d67e844982da6fa\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://2455248c8ddd9cc6a7af76a13973cddf222072427e7b0e2a7d1aff345145e931\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmfYjnjRbWqYpuxurqveE6HtzsY1Xx323J428AKQgtBJZm\"]}},\"version\":1}","zk_version":"1.3.10"},"evm":{"legacyAssembly":null,"assembly":"\t.text\n\t.file\t\"Address.sol:Address\"\n\t.globl\t__entry\n__entry:\n.func_begin0:\n\tadd\t128, r0, r1\n\tst.1\t64, r1\n\tand!\t1, r2, r1\n\tjump.ne\t@.BB0_1\n\tadd\tr0, r0, r1\n\tret.revert.to_label\tr1, @DEFAULT_FAR_REVERT\n.BB0_1:\n\tcontext.get_context_u128\tr1\n\tsub.s!\t0, r1, r1\n\tjump.ne\t@.BB0_2\n\tadd\t32, r0, r1\n\tst.2\t256, r1\n\tst.2\t288, r0\n\tadd\t@CPI0_0[0], r0, r1\n\tret.ok.to_label\tr1, @DEFAULT_FAR_RETURN\n.BB0_2:\n\tadd\tr0, r0, r1\n\tret.revert.to_label\tr1, @DEFAULT_FAR_REVERT\n.func_end0:\n\n\t.note.GNU-stack\n\t.rodata\nCPI0_0:\n\t.cell 53919893334301279589334030174039261352344891250716429051063678533632\n","bytecode":{"object":"0000008001000039000000400010043f0000000101200190000000060000c13d000000000100001900000012000104300000000001000416000000000110004c0000000e0000c13d0000002001000039000001000010044300000120000004430000000501000041000000110001042e000000000100001900000012000104300000001000000432000000110001042e0000001200010430000000000000000000000002000000000000000000000000000000400000010000000000000000008c86251e82023a031c97fd297cb2ce817bb9137f73d1ed9a915d37d8f8cc1092"},"methodIdentifiers":{}},"irOptimized":"/*=====================================================*\n *                       WARNING                       *\n *  Solidity to Yul compilation is still EXPERIMENTAL  *\n *       It can result in LOSS OF FUNDS or worse       *\n *                !USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
